This little shell script opens and close the CD-ROM drive, and with simple piece of string it can drive a baby-rocker.

1. Tie a piece of string from the CD-ROM to the babyrocker
2. Adjust tension in string
3. Put your baby in the rocker
4. Run the shell-script
   ./baby_rocker.sh
   (You might have to do chmod 755 baby_rocker.sh to run it)
